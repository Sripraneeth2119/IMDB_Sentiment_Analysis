# IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis

In this project, I have used the IMDB Sentiment analysis Dataset from Kaggle. As part of my project, I have tokenized the reviews and then eliminated the unessential words using stopwords. Later I converted the text into vectors using One Hot Encoding and later used the LSTM RNN model. I have obtained 87.67% accuracy.
